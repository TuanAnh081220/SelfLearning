Notes: 모양 is generally used to mean “shape.” For example:
종이를 이런 모양으로 접어 보세요 = try folding the paper into this type of shape
네모 모양 안경을 쓰는 사람이 점점 많아지고 있어요
= There are more and more people wearing square (shaped) glasses
나무 모양 버튼을 누르면 그 나무에 대한 정보가 나올 것이다
= If you press the tree-shaped button, you can hear information about that tree
It can also be used to refer to one’s general feelings or dignity – usually after they have been damaged to some extent. For example:
얼굴이 이 모양이면 밖에 나가기 싫어요 = I don’t want to go outside with my face in this state
It is also used as a noun after the future ~는 것 principle to indicate that some situation “looks like” something. This is often seen as a separate grammatical principle, and hasn’t been covered in our Lessons yet. For example:
학교에서 재미있는 것을 많이 배울 모양이에요 = It looks like you are learning lots of fun things at school
