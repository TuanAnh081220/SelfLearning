Notes: This word is very similar to the word “자리,” but 자리 is more broad and can be used to refer to any place that is/can be occupied by something/someone. On the other hand, 좌석 is more specific and only refers to a place that one sits in (in a car, a stadium, etc…). It can sometimes be similar to the word “의자” (chair), but 의자 is even more specific and refers to an actual chair itself. For example, a seat to sit on while riding the subway can be referred to as “자리” (because it is a place that can be occupied) or “좌석” (because it refers to a place that one sits in), but not “의자” (because it is not a chair).
Common Usages:
좌석 버스 = a certain type of bus in Korea with little standing room, but a lot of seats
임산부좌석 = a seat for pregnant women
앞 좌석 = a front-row seat
Examples:
혹시 무대에 더 가까운 좌석이 있어요? = Do you happen to have a seat closer to the stage?
제가 임산부좌석에 앉아 있었는데 임산부가 버스를 타서 자리에 일어나야 되었어요 = I was sitting the seat reserved for pregnant women, but then a pregnant woman got on the bus, so I had to get up
