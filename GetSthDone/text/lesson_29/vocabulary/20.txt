Notes: In English, “rice” could refer to cooked or uncooked rice. If I went to the store, I would tell you to buy “rice,” and I wouldn’t specify that you should buy “uncooked rice.” In Korean, when you go to the store to buy rice, you shouldn’t use “밥” to refer to rice. “밥” in this case would generally refer to food. “쌀” is the word used for uncooked rice – the type of rice you would find in a massive sack at the supermarket.
Common Usages:
쌀을 씻다 = to wash rice (Korean people usually “wash/rinse” their rice before cooking it)
쌀밥 = steamed rice
찹쌀 = a type of gluttonous rice cake
Example:
쌀을 씻은 후에 밥솥에 넣으면 됩니다 = After washing the rice, you can put it in the rice-cooker
