Notes: 제사 is a tradition in Korea where family members gather and pay respect to ancestors who passed away (usually one’s father or grandfather). Families usually gather and prepare a bunch of food and it is typically performed on the anniversary of the ancestor’s death and the two major Korean holidays추석 and 설날.
Common Usages:
제사상 = the table that the prepared food is placed on during 제사
제사를 지내다  = to do 제사 (지내다 is the verb that is used with 제사)
제사상을 준비하다 = to prepare the table for 제사
Examples:
한국에서는 매년 2번씩 제사를 지내요 = In Korea, 제사 is observed twice every year
우리는 제사 때문에 할아버지 집에 갔어요 = We went to our grandfather’s house because of 제사
추석에 제사상을 준비하기 위해 친척들이 모두 아침 일찍 큰집으로 모여요 = During Chuseok, in order to prepare the table for 제사, family members (relatives) all meet at the “big house” (the house of the oldest son) early in the morning
