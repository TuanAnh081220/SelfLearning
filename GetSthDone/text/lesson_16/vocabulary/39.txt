Notes: Used as a conjunctive adverb, usually between two sentences.
Examples:
친구가 한국에 왔어요. 그러나, 그녀를 만날 수 없었어요 = My friend came to Korea. However, I couldn’t meet her
미연은 내게서 시선을 돌리며 텔레비전 화면을 쳐다봤다. 그러나 화면 속 내용을 보고 있는 것 같지는 않았다
= As 미연 removed her eyes from me, she stared at the TV screen. However, (despite the fact that she was looking at the TV, which would make you expect that she was actually watching the TV), she probably wasn’t watching the TV
