Notes: 근처 and 가깝다 are words that have similar meanings. 근처 is actually a noun but I feel it acts and feels like an adverb. 가깝다 is an adjective, which means it can predicate sentences and describe upcoming nouns. 근처 is most commonly used after a noun (like 위, 안, 밑, 뒤, etc…) to mean “close to…” for example:
대학로 근처에 극장이 많아요 = There are a lot of theaters near 대학로
It can also be used to generally just mean “close” to here. In these cases, 여기 can be omitted:
저의 친구는 (여기) 근처에 살아요 = My friend lives close (to here)
