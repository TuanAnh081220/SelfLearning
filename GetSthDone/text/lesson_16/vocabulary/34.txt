Examples:
한국사람들이 가슴에 털이 없어요 = Korean people don’t have hair on their chest
그 여자가 가슴이 커요 = That woman has big breasts
심장이 멈춘 듯이 가슴이 아파요 = My chest hurts as if my heart has stopped
당신의 눈을 응시할 때 가슴이 설레어요 = When I gaze into your eyes, my heart flutters
가슴이 떨릴 때는 심호흡을 깊게 하면 진정이 돼요 = When you are nervous, if you breathe deeply you can be calmed down
