Notes: When teachers at my school receive formal training for their job (similar to “professional development” in western countries), they call this type of training “연수.”
Also, once per year at my school all staff members go on trip to some interesting tourist destination and have a good time. Very little “training” is done during these outings, but I guess the goal is to improve camaraderie and relationships. Nonetheless, this is called “연수.”
Common Usages:
어학연수 = to study abroad for the purpose of learning a language
직원연수 = employee training
교직원연수 = teacher training
Examples:
연수를 받으러 갑시다 = Let’s go to receive the training
그 문제에 관해 연수를 받았어요 = We/I received training about that problem
연수를 받으시고 싶다면 내일까지 신청하시기 바랍니다
= If you want to receive the training, please apply by tomorrow
오늘은 직원연수가 있어 모든 직원들이 11시에 모여서 버스로 출발할 예정이에요
= There is employee training today, and all employees are scheduled to meet at 11 and leave by bus
