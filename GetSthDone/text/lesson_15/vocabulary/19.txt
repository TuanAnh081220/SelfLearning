Common Usages:
물속 = inside the water
뱃속 = inside a stomach/belly
꿈속에 = in one’s dream
Notes: Korean people can’t explain the difference between 안 and 속.
속 is more commonly used when, if you enter something, the place will be filled with stuff and is not “empty”. Conversely, “안” would be more commonly used when, if you enter something, the place is basically empty.
For example, if you enter water or if you enter your body. In both cases, “속” would be used to refer to the inside of a body, or the inside of water. If you enter your body, it is filled with stuff, and if you enter the water, it is still all water.
The opposite is if you are talking about a room, or a building. You can go into those places and it is relatively empty.
Example: 저는 속이 안 좋아요 = I don’t feel good (my insides aren’t good)
