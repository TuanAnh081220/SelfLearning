Notes: In English, we call athletes who play game-like sports “players.” For example, a basketball “player.” However, other athletes are not called “players,” for example, it would be unnatural to call a swimmer a “swimming player.” In Korean, the word 선수 is used to refer to any athlete of any sport.
Common Usages:
축구선수 = soccer player

선수는 숨을 못 쉬도록 뛰었어요 = The athlete ran to the extent that he couldn’t breathe
선수가 공을 골대에 넣자마자 관중들은 환호하기 시작했어요
