The pronunciation of this word is closer to “목쩍찌”
Notes: As you know, “목적” translates to “goal.” 지 is a common Hanja character (地) that refers to land or a place. Together, “목적지” literally refers to the “goal” place or “the place one is headed towards.” This is easier translated to just “destination.”
Common Usages:
목적지에 도착하다 = to arrive at a destination
목적지를 정하다 = to decide on a destination
최종목적지 = final destination
Examples:
우리가 목적지에 거의 도착했어요 = We have almost arrived at our destination
최종목적지가 어디예요? = Where is your final destination?
