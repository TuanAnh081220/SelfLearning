Notes: Although this typically translates to “waist,” Korean people often say “허리(가) 아프다” when their lower-back is sore. For example, if somebody came home after a hard day of work with lots of standing around and/or physical labor, he/she would say “아우! 허리 아파!” In English, it would be unnatural to say “Ahh! My waist hurts!” It would be more natural to say “My back hurts.”
Common Usages:
허리가 아프다 = for one’s back to be sore
허리를 구부리다/굽히다 = to bend over
Examples:
하루 종일 일을 해서 이제 허리가 아파요 = My back is sore after working all day
