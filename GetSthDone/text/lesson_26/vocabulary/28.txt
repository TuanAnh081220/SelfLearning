The pronunciation of this word is closer to “영업 씨간”
Notes: Although “영업” is a word by itself (which is one meaning of the word “business”), for a beginner of Korean the most common place you will see this word is as “영업 시간,” which refers to the time that a business is in operation during the day. You would most likely see this written on a sign outside of a store/restaurant or any type of business to indicate their hours.
Examples:
우리 영업시간은 오전 8시부터 오후 5시까지입니다 = Our business hours are from 8 am to 5 pm
영업시간이 몇 시부터 몇 시까지예요? = From when to when are you open? (What are your business hours?)
