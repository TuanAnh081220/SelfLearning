Notes: If you place 사이 after nouns, it represents the space between them. For example:
저는 차 두 대 사이에서 서 있어요 = I am standing between two cars
그 건물과 우리 학교 사이에 사거리가 있어요 = There is an intersection between our school and that building
It is also used to indicate that the relationship “between” people:
저와 학생들 사이는 좋아요 = The relationship between my students and me is good
This word appears in my Korean Sign Explanation Video 5.
