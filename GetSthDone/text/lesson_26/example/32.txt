In theory, the full sentence (저는 밥을 먹을 것이에요) could translate to “I am a thing that will eat rice.” However, it would never be translated like that because when ~ㄹ/을 것이다 is used at the end of a sentence, it is usually done to create the future tense conjugation that would translate to “one will do…” This isn’t imperative to your understanding, but it is good to recognize that ~ㄹ/을 has the same function in both of these types of sentences – which is describing the noun in-front of it.
