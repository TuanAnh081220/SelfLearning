Notes: 살 is used to refer to the flesh/meat of an animal. For example, I often say this sentence to Korean people when they ask me why I don’t eat fish:
캐나다에서는 생선을 먹을 때 살밖에 없는데 한국에서는 생선을 먹을 때 접시에 진짜 물고기가 있어요
= In Canada, when we eat fish, there is nothing but flesh (the meaty part of the fish). However, in Korean, when you eat fish, there is an actual fish on the plate.
As it refers to the meaty/fleshy part of animals, it also refers to the mass that humans can gain or lose. As such, it is used when somebody wants to indicate that one “gains” or “loses” weight. For example
Common Usages:
살이 찌다 = to gain weight
살이 빠지다 = to lose weight
살을 빼다 = to purposely lose weight (this is usually used as “살을 빼고 싶다” or “살을 빼야 한다”
Examples:
나는 살이 많이 빠졌어 = I lost a lot of weight
나는 작년에 살이 많이 쪘어 = I gained a lot of weight last year
선생님이 살이 쪘을 것 같아요 = The teacher probably gained weight
살을 빼기 위해 많은 여자들이 다이어트를 해요 = Many women go on diets in order to lose weight
햄버거를 계속 먹다 보니 살이 많이 쪘어요 = While/after eating hamburgers continually (over a period of time), I realized that I gained a lot of weight
