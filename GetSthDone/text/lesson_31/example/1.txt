[직업이] 선생님인 사람들은 인기가 많아요 = People who[se jobs] are teachers are popular
(It sounds slightly more natural to say “직업이 선생님인 사람들” in this case instead of just “선생님인 사람들.” Remember here that the entire clause before “~인” is describing the upcoming noun. In this case, the clause is “직업이 선생님이다” which would unnaturally translate to something like “the job is a teacher”. However, when put in the place of describing an upcoming noun, it can translate to “직업이 선생님인 사람들 = people whose jobs are teachers”. At any rate, try not to worry about the use of “직업” (as I realize it might be difficult) in that sentence and focus more on the big picture of what adding “~ㄴ” to 이다 accomplishes.
