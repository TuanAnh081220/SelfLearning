Notes: The Korean age system is different than most of the world. In Korea, everybody born in a particular year is the same age. While Korean people still celebrate their birthdays, they do not get “older” on that day. Everybody in Korea gets one year older on new year’s day. Therefore, you can use “동갑” with anybody who is born the same year as you.
Examples:
우리는 동갑이야 = We are the same age
너와 동갑인 여자를 만나야 돼 = You need to meet a girl who is your age
