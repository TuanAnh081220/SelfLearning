The pronunciation of this word is closer to “목꺼리”
Notes: “~걸이” is usually attached to a noun to indicate that it is a rack that you can hang a particular object onto. For example, a “수건걸이” would be some kind of towel rack.
However, the words 목걸이 and 귀걸이 don’t describe the rack that you can hang an object onto. Rather, they describe the objects that are being hung.
