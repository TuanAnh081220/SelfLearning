Notes: “~걸이” is usually attached to a noun to indicate that it is a rack that you can hang a particular object onto. For example, a “수건걸이” would be some kind of towel rack.
However, the words 목걸이 and 귀걸이 don’t describe the rack that you can hang an object onto. Rather, they describe the objects that are being hung.
The word 귀고리 is also acceptable. “고리” by itself refers to some kind of metal that is bent into a circle (or similar shape). Another example would be 열쇠고리 (a key-chain). In theory, “귀걸이” refers to an earring that is long and dangling and “귀고리” refers to an earring that is in the shape of a hoop. However, the majority of Korean people would not be aware of this.
Common Usages:
귀걸이를 풀다 = to untie/take off an earring
귀걸이를 하다 = to wear an earring
Examples:
계단을 올라가다가 귀걸이가 떨어졌어요 = My earing(s) fell out while walking up the stairs
