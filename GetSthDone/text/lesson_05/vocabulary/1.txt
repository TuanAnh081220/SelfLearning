Common Usages:
남동생 = younger brother
여동생 = younger sister
친동생 = biological younger sibling
Notes:
While technically this word means “younger sibling” Korean will refer to a close friend (who is younger than them) using this word. This often leads to dialogues like this:
Korean person: “Hey! This is my 동생!”
Me: “Really?”
Korean person: “No, not really.”
To distinguish that somebody is actually related to you by blood, they use the word “친동생”
Examples:
저 사람은 저의 동생이에요 = That person is my younger sibling
동생은 왜 울었어요? = Why did your brother/sister cry?
