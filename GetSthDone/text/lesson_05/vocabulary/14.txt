Notes: You can use this word to refer to anybody who looks the age of a grandmother, not just your own grandmother.
Example:
저의 할머니는 요리를 너무 잘해요 = My grandmother cooks very well
저의 할머니가 여기에 자주 안 오셔요 = My grandmother doesn’t come here often
저는 할머니를 위해 식사를 준비했어요 = I prepared a meal for grandmother
할머니는 어제 아파서 입원했어요 = Grandma checked into the hospital yesterday because she was sick
