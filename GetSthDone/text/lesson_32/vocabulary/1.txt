Notes: 차량 refers to any vehicle on the road – not just a car, but any type of vehicle.
Common Usages:
차량금지 = no vehicles
Examples:
장애인 차량 외 주차금지 = No parking except for handicapped vehicles
(this is not a sentence, but you will see stuff like this written on signs)
일반차량 추자시 즉시 과태료가 부과됩니다
= If you park a regular vehicle here, a fine will be imposed immediately
