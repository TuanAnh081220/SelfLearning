The pronunciation of this word is closer to “치꽈 의사”
Notes: This literally translates to “tooth area/field doctor.”
As this is actually two words, there should be a space between them. However, Korean people often omit the space.
Examples:
치과 의사는 저의 이를 두 개 뺐어요 = The dentist took out two of my teeth
치과 의사가 환자에게 고통을 참을 수 있냐고 물어봤어요 = The dentist asked if I could endure the pain
치과 의사가 저의 이가 아주 약하다고 했어요 = The dentist said my teeth are very weak
