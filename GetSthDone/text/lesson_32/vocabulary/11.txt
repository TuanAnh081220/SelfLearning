Notes: This word is commonly used after somebody completes some sort of difficult task. It is a way that Korean people express their sympathy when somebody does something difficult.  The “difficult task” can be something trivial as well, like driving a car for an hour. Either way, once this task is completed, somebody might say to you “고생했어요!” For example, if you took the subway to your mother’s house for about an hour, upon arrival she might say:
왔어? 아이고~ 고생했어… = You came? Ahh… it must have been hard
“아이고” isn’t a word, but it is muttered by Korean people everywhere. It is commonly said when something difficult is/was/will be done. For example, if an old lady is walking up the stairs, she’ll say “아이고” to herself.
Examples:
집을 구하느라 고생을 많이 했어요 = It was hard and stressful finding a new house
이렇게 많은 내용을 학생들에게 가르치려고 고생을 많이 했어요 = I worked hard/suffered in order to teach that much content to the students
