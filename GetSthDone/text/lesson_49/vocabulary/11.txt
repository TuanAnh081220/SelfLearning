The pronunciation of this word is closer to “기엉녁”
Notes: This refers to one’s memory ability or power. It is not used to refer to an event in the past.
For example:
기억력이 좋다 = for one’s memory to be good
기억력이 나쁘다 = for one’s memory to be bad
Examples:
핸드폰에 연락처 기능이 있어서 요즘에 사람들은 기억력이 좋지 않아도 돼요
= Cell phones have contact functions in them so these days people don’t need to have a good memory
