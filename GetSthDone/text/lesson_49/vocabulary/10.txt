The pronunciation of this word is closer to “자격쯩”
Notes: “증” refers to some sort of proof that one can, or is allowed to do something. For example:
면허증 = drivers licence (a card showing that one can/is allowed to drive)
학생증 = student card (a card showing that one is a student)
As such, 자격증 is a document that shows proof that one is qualified in something.
Common Examples:
자격증을 따다 = to get a certification/certified
Examples:
자격증을 안 보여줘도 돼요? = I don’t need to show you my certification?
한국에 젊은이들은 취업을 하기 위해 많은 자격증을 따요 = Young people in Korea obtain a lot of certificates to get hired
