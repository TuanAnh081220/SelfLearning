한편 has different usages. In its most simple usage, it can be used to indicate the same side or same direction. For example:
너랑 나는 항상 한편이야 = You and I are always on the same side
It is also possible to be used to mean “on the other hand.” When used like this, there are usually two clauses that oppose each other connected by some grammatical principle that means “although.” In this usage,~으로 it is commonly attached to 한편. For example:
저는 결혼한 게 좋지만 한편으로 결혼 전 생활도 그리워요
= I like being married, but, on the other hand, I also miss my life before I got married
일을 해서 돈을 버는 게 좋지만 한편으로 자유 시간이 없어서 일을 하고 싶지 않아요
= Working and earning money is good, but, on the other hand, I don’t want to work because I don’t have any free time
한 명 한 명에게 편지를 쓰다 보니 함께 쌓아온 추억이 생각나면서 기분이 좋아졌다. 한편으로는 친구들을 다시 볼 수 없다는 생각에 나는 마음이 아팠다.
= While writing letters to each of my friends, I realized/thought about all of the memories that piled up (with those friends), so I was very happy. On the other hand, the thought of not being able to see those friends again made me upset.
