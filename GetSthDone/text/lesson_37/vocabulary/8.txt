Notes: One day holidays in Korea can fall in the middle of the week, in which case they are not considered “연휴.” However, it is possible that a one day holiday lines up with a weekend, in which case it would create a long weekend. In these cases, it can be called a “연휴.” The Hanja characters for 연휴 mean “connected”(連) and “holiday/break”(休) respectively.
Common Usages:
추석연휴 = Chuseok holiday (three day holiday in the fall around Thanksgiving)
설날연휴 = Seolnal holiday (three day holiday in the winter)
황금연휴 = When 추석 or 설날 line up with weekends to create an extended holiday
Examples:
이번 주말이 연휴라서 우리 엄마 집에 갈 거예요
= This weekend is a long weekend, so I will go to our mom’s house
내년 추석은 일주일 내내 쉴 수 있는 황금연휴예요
= Next year, Chuseok will be an extra long holiday where we can rest for a week
이번 주말이 연휴라서 특별한 계획이 있나요?
= This weekend is a long weekend, so do you have any special plans?
