Notes: “Lunch boxes” are usually different in Korea compared to the west. Nevertheless, the food one brings to work, school or some event to eat later is usually referred to a “도시락.” It doesn’t necessarily need to be for lunch, but the translation is usually a “lunch box”
Common Usages:
도시락반찬 = lunch box side dishes
도시락을 싸다 = to pack a lunch box
Examples:
제가 어렸을 때는 엄마가 매일 도시락을 싸 줬어요
= When I was young, my mom packed a lunch box for me everyday
아침에 엄마가 싸 준 도시락을 깜박하고 안 가져왔어요
= I forgot to bring the lunch box that my mom packed for me in the morning
도시락을 안 가져와서 점심을 못 먹을 거예요
= I won’t be able to eat lunch because I didn’t bring my lunch box
엄마는 나와 아빠를 위해 도시락을 만들어서 점심으로 그 도시락을 먹을 거다.
= Mom made a lunch box for dad and I, so we will eat that for lunch.
