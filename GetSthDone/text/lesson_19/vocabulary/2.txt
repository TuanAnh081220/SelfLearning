Common Usages:
키가 크다 = to be tall
키가 작다 = to be short
Notes: 키 means “height” in Korean, but not the “height” of a building or some other object. It is only used when talking about the height of a person. “크다” means ‘big.’ The adjective for tall is 키가 크다, which just indicates that your height is big.
Example:
그 남자가 키가 너무 커요 = That man is very tall
저는 그보다 키가 더 커요 = I am taller than him
