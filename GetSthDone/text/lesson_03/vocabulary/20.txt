Notes: Though 너무 means “too,” it has gotten to the point in society where Korean people use “너무” to mean “very” as well (especially with the younger generation). Whereas “too” should indicate a negative meaning, 너무 can indicate both a positive and negative meaning. For example, saying “이것은 너무 맛있어요” would not translate to “this is too delicious” but instead “this is very/so delicious.”
Examples:
저는 가끔 너무 많이 먹어요 = I eat too much sometimes
저는 어제 너무 아팠어요 = I was really sick yesterday
한식은 너무 맛있어요 = Korean food is very delicious
그 남자가 키가 너무 커요 = That man is very tall
이 길이 너무 좁아서 저는 못 들어가요 = I can’t go onto this road because it is too narrow
제가 너무 부끄러워서 발표를 못해요 = I can’t do presentations (well) because I am too shy
선생님은 우리를 너무 잘 가르치셨어요 = Our teacher taught us really well
왜 너무 빨리 먹었어요? = Why did you eat so fast?
이 셔츠가 너무 작아서 못 입어요 = I can’t put this shirt on because it is too small
