Notes: The translation of 겨우 is typically “barely” but it has two main usages. For the first usage, I like to imagine a line, and when 겨우 is used the action is just able to cross the line. For example:
늦잠을 자서 출근시간을 겨우 맞췄다 = I slept in and I just managed to arrive on time
Here, if you imagine the line is the “출근시간” (the time work starts) the speaker just crossed the line and made it to work on time
It can also be used to emphasize that some action or number is smaller than one would expect. For example:
겨우 50만원을 벌기 위해 이렇게 열심히 일했다고 생각하니 허무했어요
= Thinking about how hard you say you worked in order to make a measly 50만원, you wasted your time
겨우 이런 일 가지고 친구가 저한테 실망을 하다니 믿을 수가 없었어요
= For such a small thing I can’t believe that my friend is disappointed in me
