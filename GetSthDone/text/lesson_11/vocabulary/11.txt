Notes: 지난 can be placed before some indicators of time to mean “last ….”
There are two similar but different meanings for the word “last” in English. 지난 is used for only ONE of those meanings. 지난 is used to talk about something in the past, as in “last night I went to bed late.” It is not used to talk about the last thing in a sequence. See Lessons 10 and 11 for more information.
