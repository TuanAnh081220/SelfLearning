Notes: If I asked 100 people in Canada what their job is, I would probably only get the answer “office worker” a few times. In Korea however, probably 50% of the people would respond with “office worker.” Many Korean people work for big companies in offices, not all doing the same thing obviously, but I’m not exactly sure what they’re all doing in there. Korea has no real natural resources, so the major industry is just “working and business.”
You will see the suffix “원” attached to different words to refer to people.
Example:
한국에서는 회사원이 진짜 많아요 = There are a lot of office workers in Korea
우리 회사는 새로운 회사원을 찾고 있어요 = Our company is looking for new workers
