Common Usages
이틀 동안 = for two days
이틀에 한 번 = once per two days
Notes: When counting the number of days, you can usually say something like “5일” (five days). However, for a small number of days (one day, two days) there is a special word that corresponds to that number of days. “이 일” to mean “two days” would be used, but 이틀 would be more common.
Example:
우리는 계곡에 이틀 동안 갈 거예요 = We are going to the valley for two days
저는 이틀 동안 안 잤어요 = I didn’t sleep for two days
우리는 이틀 동안 미국에 있었어요 = We were in America for two days
우리는 이틀 전에 한국에 왔어요 = We came to Korea two days ago
저는 그 친구를 이틀 후에 만날 거예요 = I will meet that friend two days from now
