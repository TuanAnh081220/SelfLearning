Notes: Even though “사” (‘four’) is in the word “사흘,” I assure you that 사흘 means “3 days.” Many Korean people think that “사흘” actually means “four days,” and I have pwned some Korean people by showing them that it actually means “three days” by looking it up in the Korean-Korean dictionary with them.
Example:
저는 사흘 동안 밥을 안 먹었어요 = I didn’t eat rice for 3 days
