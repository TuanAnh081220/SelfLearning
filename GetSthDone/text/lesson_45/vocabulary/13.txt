Notes: This sounds ridiculous, but 등 can be used to have seemingly opposite meanings.
More commonly, it can be added after a list to indicate that there are more examples that can be added to that list. This can typically be translated to “etc…” For example:
서울, 부산, 제주도 등 한국에서는 관광을 할 수 있는 많은 지역이 있어요
= There are many places you can travel/tour in Korea, like Seoul, Busan, Jeju, and etc…
계절이 바뀌면서 겨울잠바, 신발 등 사야 할 게 많아요
= When the season changes, there are many things you need to buy, like a winter jumper, shoes, etc…
It can also be added after a list to indicate that the examples on a list are limited to those already mentioned. For example:
저는 2주 동안 대만, 태국, 베트남 등 세 개국을 여행할 거예요 = I will travel to three places during the next two weeks; Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam
The context usually makes it clear which is being used. For example, in the second usage, there is usually some specific indication of the amount of things that are being acted on. As you can see in the example above, the use of “세 개국” indicates that “three countries” will be traveled.
