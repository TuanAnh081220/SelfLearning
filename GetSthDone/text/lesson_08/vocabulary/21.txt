The pronunciation of this word is closer to “즉씨”
Notes: 즉시 can only be used to indicate that something happens immediately (in terms of time). It is less common than 바로.
Example:
저는 그 무서운 것을 보고 즉시 뛰어갔어요 = I ran away immediately after I saw that scary thing
This word appears in my Korean Sign Explanation Video 4.
