Notes: This is a combination of the adjective “검다” (black) and “색” (color). Put together, the word is a noun that means “the color black,” but is often placed before nouns to describe them (like an adjective) anyways. Therefore, you can often see this (and other words of color) used before a noun to describe it and also at the end of a sentence (attached to 이다).
When Korean people describe something by color in English, they will often say something like “I like the black-colored shirt.” This is the result of them directly translating “검은색 셔츠,” whereas in English we would just say “black shirt.”
Examples:
At the end of a sentence: 저의 차는 검은색이에요 = My car is black
(Notice 이다 is used because 검은색 is a noun)
Before a noun: 저는 검은색 차를 좋아해요 = I like black cars
