Notes: As you know, one of the meanings of 있다 (the verb form) is to indicate that one is in or at a location. For example: 저는 집에 있어요 = I am at home
In English, we would never apply an imperative conjugation to this type of sentence. For example, if I wanted to tell somebody to “be” at home, I would never say “집에 있어! = Be at home!”
In English, I would rather use the word “to stay” to express this. For example: “Stay at home!”
However, in Korean it is common to attach an imperative ending to this meaning of 있다 to tell somebody to “stay” somewhere. 가만히 is often used in sentences like this to tell somebody to “stay” still. For example:
가만히 있어! = Stay still!/Don’t move!
Example:
저는 딸한테 움직이지 말고5분 동안 그냥 가만히 있으라고 했어요 = I told my daughter not to move for 5 minutes and to just sit/stay there
