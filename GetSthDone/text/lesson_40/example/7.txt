Notes: Notes: 수고하다 is often used when leaving a place of business (like a store or office). Korean people usually say “수고하세요!” which literally translates to telling somebody to “work hard.” This would be very awkward to say in English, but is common in Korean.
It is also possible to say “수고했어요!” to thank a person for helping you in some way. Essentially, you are telling the person that he/she worked hard, and that you are thankful for this.
