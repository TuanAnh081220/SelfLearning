Notes: Very common noun that you can use to say “I am interested” in something. “~에” is added to the thing you are interested in, and 관심 is followed by ~이 있다. Translates directly to “I have interest in ____.”
Examples:
저는 한국역사에 관심이 있어요 = I am interested in Korean history
그 학생은 과학에 관심이 별로 없어요 = That student doesn’t really have any interest in science
