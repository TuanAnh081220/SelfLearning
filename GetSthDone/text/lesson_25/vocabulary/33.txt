Common Usages:
애기를 키우다 = to raise a baby
애기를 낳다 = to give birth to a baby
애기가 귀엽다 = for a baby to be cute
Notes: I believe the word was originally “아기” but through constant mispronunciation, the word has now evolved to “애기.”
People often call their boyfriend or girlfriend “애기.” This makes some people sick.

우리 애기는 이제 두 살이에요 = Our baby is now two years old
애기들은 과자를 많이 먹어요 = Babies eat a lot of candy
애기 수영장은 깊지 않아요 = Baby swimming pools are not deep
