Notes: ~에 is typically not attached to 언젠가. In both English and Korean, it isn’t logical to make sentences with “until somewhere” or “from somewhere.”
Example:
저는 언젠가 선생님이 되고 싶어요 = I want to become a teacher someday
그 날이 언젠가 올 거예요 = The day will come sometime
구름이 언젠가 걷힐 거예요 = The clouds will clear eventually/sometime
저는 언젠가 경찰관이 되고 싶어요 = I want to become a police officer someday
저는 언젠가 중국어도 배우고 싶어요 = I want to learn Chinese as well some day
저는 언젠가 고향에 돌아가고 싶어요 = I want to return (go back) to my hometown some day
