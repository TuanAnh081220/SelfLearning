Notes: In English the word “menu” is only about the physical book where foods are written in a restaurant. In Korean people use the word “메뉴” when talking about the types of food served at a restaurant. Therefore, you will often hear things like “이 식당의 메뉴는 어때요?” (What do you think about the types of food at this restaurant?)
Example:
그 식당은 메뉴를 바꿨어요 = That restaurant changed its menu (changed the types of food that are served)
