Notes: The subject and object particles in general can be omitted from any sentence (although I don’t suggest omitting particles until you have a very deep understanding of Korean), but they seem to be more commonly omitted from these types of sentences.
Example:
저는 방금 뭔가(를) 봤어요 = I just saw something a minute ago
등에 뭔가(가) 있나요? = Is there something on my back?
저는 팔에 뭔가(가)느껴져요 = I feel something on my arm
저는 뭔가(를) 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat something
저는 뭔가(를) 말하고 싶어요 = I want to say something
