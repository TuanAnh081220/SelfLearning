I have had a few readers contact me to ask why the particle ~를 is used in the sentences above but ~가 is used in the sentences introduced earlier in the lessons (for example, in “저는 지금 갈 준비가 됐어요”). I feel like this is almost too obvious to talk about, but more than one person has asked me, so I want to provide an answer in case other learners have the same problem.
