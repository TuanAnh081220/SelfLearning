Examples:
5년 동안 노력해서 변호사가 될 가치가 있었어요
= It was worth it for me to work hard for five years and become a lawyer
그 권리에 대해 얘기하려고 변호사가 판사를 내일 만날 예정이에요
= The lawyer is scheduled to meet the judge tomorrow to talk about that right
판사가 되는 것은 변호사가 되는 것보다 더 힘들고 어려워요
= It is more difficult to become a judge than becoming a lawyer
