Notes: 수능 is short for “대학수학능력평가” and is a test that happens once per year every November in Korea. Universities base their admissions heavily on the results of this test, so it is very stressful and students spend the majority of their high school days working to get a good score on this test.
Examples:
저는 내년에 수능을 봐야 돼요 = I need to write 수능 next year
원래 대학교에 갈 계획이 있었지만 수능을 잘 못 봐서 대학교에 갈 수 없었어요
= I had plans to go to university, but I couldn’t get in because I did poorly on the Korean SAT test
대학교에 가려면 수능을 잘 봐야 돼요
= If you want to be able to go to University, you should do well on 수능
아무리 열심히 공부해도 수능을 못 본다면 대학교에 못 가요
= Regardless of how hard you study, if you don’t do well on 수능, you can’t go to University
