Notes: Incredibly common word that is used in very important situations. 자리 is some area of space, but not really 3-dimensional space. It is more space on the ground or something similar to that. For example, if somebody is standing where you are standing, you could say “get out of my place/my spot!” In that case, you can use 자리. In practice, it is very commonly used to have the meaning “seat”:
자리가 없어요 = There are no seats/there is nowhere to sit
그 책을 제자리에 두세요 = Put that book back in its place
각 자리에 번호가 쓰여 있어요 = There is a number written on each seat
