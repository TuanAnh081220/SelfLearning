Notes: 어떤 can mean “which” as in “which sport do you like best?” But it can also mean “some.” How do you differentiate if “어떤” means some or which? If the sentence is a question, it will usually mean “which.” If the sentence is not a question, it will usually mean “some.”
Examples:
어떤 남자는 어제 여기에 왔어 = Some man came here yesterday
그 학생은 어떤 여자와 지금 사귀고 있어요 = That student is going out with some girl now
