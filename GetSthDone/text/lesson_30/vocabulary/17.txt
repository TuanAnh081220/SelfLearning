Notes: 출입 refers to both actions of entering and exiting a place (like a building or a door or something like that). As a noun, it is often found before another noun describing that something is related to ‘entering and exiting.’ For example:
출입구 = doorway, place where one can exit/enter
출입문 = doorway, place where one can exit/enter
출입국사무소 = immigration office (the office of entering and exiting the country)
It is also commonly used before ‘금지’ to have a meaning similar to “do not enter.”
출입 금지 = do not enter
As a verb, it refers to the action of entering and exiting. For example:
여기에 출입하고 싶으면 회원카드를 보여줘야 돼요 = If you want to enter (and eventually exit), you need to show your membership card
