Notes: It is common to refer to the subway station (or general area) of a university by the university name (or sometimes the first syllable of the University name) followed by “~입구.” For example:
홍대입구역 = Hongdae Univesity Station
건대입구역 = Konkuk University Station
서울대입구역 = Seoul National University Station
Common Usages:
출입구 = entrance and exit
비상출입구 = emergency exit/entrance
Examples:
입구가 멀기 때문에 다른 곳으로 갈 거예요
= I’m going to go to another place because the entrance is too far
모든 영화관에는 비상상황을 대비해 다섯 개 이상의 입구가 있어야 해요
= In every movie theatre, to prepare for an emergency situation, there must be more than five exits/entrances
사람들이 대통령이 그 건물에 계시는 것을 알아서 그 건물 입구에 다가갔어요
= People knew that the president is in that building, so they approached the entrance
하지만 펭귄이 있는 곳은 동물원 입구에서 멀다고 하니 아빠와 나는 우선 다른 동물들을 먼저 봤다 =
But (because) the place the penguins are was said to be far from the zoo entrance, so Dad and I saw other animals first
