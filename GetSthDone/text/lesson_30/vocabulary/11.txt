Notes:
가족 is usually used when referring to the members of the family, but 가정 is more about the family as a whole and the interconnected relationships that make up the family. A good example is how it is used in the word 가정파괴자 (or 가정파괴범). This refers to the person who “broke” the family (a home-wrecker, I guess). Here, the home-wrecker didn’t break the individual members of the family, but broke the family as a whole and the relationships within it.
Examples:
슬기는 행복한 가정에서 자랐어요 = Seulgi grew up in a happy family
