Notes: “줄” can also be translated to “line” and can be confused with 선. “줄” usually refers to a string or rope (and is also used to refer to a queue of people). “선” is usually more abstract or something that can’t be manipulated.
Common Usages:
호선 = a line on the subway. For example, “Line 2”
차선 = a lane (of traffic) “a car line”
국경선 = border line
시선 = one’s eye line
선을 그리다 = to draw a line
선을 긋다  = to draw a line
Examples:
주차를 이 선 안에 해야 되지 않아요?  = Don’t you have to park between these lines?
2호선은 서울 도심 주위를 돌아요 = Line 2 circles around the downtown of Seoul
수학시간에 도형에 대해 배울 때는 선을 그릴 일이 많기 때문에 꼭 자를 가져와 주세요
= In math class, when you learn about figures there are many times where you will draw lines, so please bring a ruler
