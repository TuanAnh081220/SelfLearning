Notes: 너머 is used to describe a location “beyond” a specified noun. The location being described is usually ambiguous, but “너머” allows the speaker to indicate that (even though we don’t exactly where location is), we do know that it happened beyond a specific noun. For example, look at the following sentence:
저는 창문 너머로 봤어요 = I looked beyond (through) the window
Here is a picture that shows the image I have in my brain when I read that sentence:

In this sentence, we know what “저” refers to, and we know what “창문” refers to. Those are both specific things that we can point to. However, 너머refers to the area beyond the noun that it follows. In this sentence, 너무 refers to the area beyond the window, which can be represented by the green in the image below. As you can see, it is not a specific place but rather a broad area.
Below are more examples:
그렇게 높은 산을 꼭대기까지 올라가면 도시 너머로 숲이 보여요
= If you go up a high mountain like that, you can see a forest beyond the city
머리를 창문 너머로 내밀었지만 밖에 있는 친구가 저를 보지 않았어요
= I stuck my head out of the window, but my friend outside didn’t see me
친구들이랑 축구공을 차다가 공이 울타리 너머로 넘어 갔어요
= I was kicking the soccer ball with friends and then the ball went over the fence
