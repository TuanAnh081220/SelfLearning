Common Usages:
집 안에 = inside a house
방 안에 = inside a room
Notes: Position words are typically placed after a noun to indicate in which direction in reference to that noun something occurs.  ~에 is typically attached to a word of position. For example:
저의 친구는 은행 안에 있어요 = My friend is in the bank
개는 집 안에 있어요 = The dog is in the house
안 can also be used to indicate that some action is completed “within” or “inside” a time period. This usage is discussed in Lesson 24. For example:
우리는 한 시간 안에 그 일을 끝내야 돼요 = We need to finish that job/task within one hour
