어디 can be used to ask “where” something happened if the place is unknown. For example:
어디 가고 싶어요? = Where do you want to go?
어디 살아요? = Where do you live?
그것을 어디서 하고 싶어요? = Where do you want to do that?
어디에서 왔어요? = Where are you from (from where did you come?)
The particle ~까지 is commonly attached to 어디. ~부터 is not commonly attached to 어디 for the same reason that ~부터 is not commonly attached to a place, as described in Lesson 12. For example:
어디까지 가고 싶어요? = How far/until where do you want to go?
지하철을 어디까지 탈 거예요? = Until where will we ride the subway?
Like 언제, it can also be used as the noun before 이다 to ask where something “is.” For example:
어디야? = Where are you?
This is really only done when speaking to a person, and you are asking him/her directly where he/she is. When asking where another person, or another thing is, it is more natural to use 있다 in the sentence. For example:
친구가 어디에 있어요? = Where is your friend?
엄마가 어디에 있어요? = Where is mom?
펜이 어디에 있어요? = Where is the pen?
