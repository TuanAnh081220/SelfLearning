As an adverb, 언제 can be used to ask “when” something happens. For example:
집에 언제 갔어? = When did you go home?
집에 언제 갈 거야? = When will you go home?
그 여자가 언제 사라졌어요? = When did that girl disappear?
낮잠을 언제 잤어요? = When did you take a nap?
아빠가 언제 왔나요? = When did dad come?
Particles like ~부터 and ~까지, which are often used to indicate from/until when something happens can be attached to 언제 to indicate that it is unknown “from/until when” something happens. For example:
언제부터 아팠어요? = Since when have you been sick?
한국에서 언제까지 있을 거예요? = Until when will you be in Korea?
언제부터 한국어를 공부했어요? = Since when have you been studying Korean?
언제 can also be attached to “이다” to ask “when” something is. In these cases as well, it replaces the noun that would normally be attached to 이다. For example:
결혼식은 언제야? = When is the wedding?
방학은 언제야? = When is vacation?
