벌써 can be used to indicate that one action has “already” happened. These actions are usually finished when then speaker uses “벌써.” For example:
저는 그 사실을 벌써 알고 있었어요 = I already knew that fact
내가 밥을 벌써 먹어서 지금 먹고 싶지 않아 = Because I already ate, I don’t want to eat now
It can also be used to indicate that an action happens earlier than expected. These actions don’t have to be finished for the speaker to use 벌써. For example:
벌써 나갈 거야? = You are already leaving?
학교가 벌써 끝났어요? = School is already finished?
