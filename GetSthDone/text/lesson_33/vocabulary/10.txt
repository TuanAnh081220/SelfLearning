Notes: There are two types of blind dates in Korea. One is called “소개팅,” where two people are set up by family/friends and meet for the first time. Another type of blind date is called “미팅” where multiple people who don’t know each other all meet at the same time.
Examples:
오빠가 미팅을 하는 중이에요 = My brother is on a “meeting” (a group blind date)
우리는 미팅으로 만났어요 = We met on a “meeting” date
