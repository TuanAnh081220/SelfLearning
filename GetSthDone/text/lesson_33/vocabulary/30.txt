Notes: Often times the choices/options are given in a previous sentence/clause and they are being referred to in a later sentence/clause. When this is the case, you can use “그중” to mean “among/between those things previously mentioned.”
Examples:
바나나와 사과를 샀어요. 그중에 어떤 것을 먹고 싶어요? = I bought bananas and apples. Between those two, which one do you want to eat?
