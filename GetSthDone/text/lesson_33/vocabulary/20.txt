Notes: A lot of Korean stores are these buildings called “상가.” Typically, this is a building made out of marble and has signs plastered all over the outside of it. In one of these buildings, there may be dozens upon dozens of stores (or other things like restaurants and other places of business).  Stores in these buildings typically do not sell brand name products, although sometimes you will find a store in a 상가 that sells one specific brand name. The more popular brand names/stores would be on the ground floor of the building usually facing the street, while to get to other random stores you might have to go in and go up a few floors.
Common Usages:
상가임대 = Retail Space for Lease (most likely seen on a sign/advertisement)
Examples:
그 상가가 지금 공사 중이에요 = That building is under construction
