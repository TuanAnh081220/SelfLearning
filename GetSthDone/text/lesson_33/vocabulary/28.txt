The pronunciation of this word is closer to “물꼬기”
Notes: The word “물고기” (literally water meat) is used to refer to the animals themselves. “생선” is used to refer to the fish that we eat.
Common Usages:
물고기를 잡다 = to catch a fish
물고기를 키우다 = to raise/have a pet fish
Examples: 그 물고기에 살이 없어요 = There is no meat on that fish
캐나다에서는 생선을 먹을 때 살밖에 없는데 한국에서는 생선을 먹을 때 접시에 진짜 물고기가 있어요
= In Canada, when we eat fish, there is nothing but flesh (the meaty part of the fish). However, in Korean, when you eat fish, there is an actual fish on the plate.
