Notes: 저 is another example of a “관형사” in Korean. 저 is placed before nouns that are far away (not within reach). For example, if you want to refer to the person across the street, you can refer to “that person” by saying “저 사람.”
그 and 저 both translate to “that.” This often causes confusion for English speakers.
Also notice that “저” has more than one meaning. Earlier, you saw that “저” means “I/me.” Welcome to the world of Korean! Where often times one word has more than one meaning.
Common Usages:
저것 = that thing
저 사람 = that person
See more information about 관형사 in my description of “이” above.
Examples:
저 사람은 누구예요? = Who is that person?
저는 저 케이크를 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat that cake
저 바지가 얼마예요? = How much are those pants?
저의 친구는 저 쪽으로 갔어요 = My friend went that way
저 학교는 역사적인 건물이에요 = That school is a historical building
다음 버스는 저 정류장에서 출발할 거예요 = The next bus will depart from that station
