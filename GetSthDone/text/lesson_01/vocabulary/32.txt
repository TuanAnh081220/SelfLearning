Notes: Informally, you can say “응” to mean “yes”
When speaking on the phone, Korean people often say this many times and pronounce it as “데”
Example
네, 저는 가고 싶어요 = Yes, I want to go
네, 알겠습니다 = Yes, okay. (I got it)
네, 그렇습니다 = Yes, that is correct (that is the way it is)
네, 그럴게요 = Yes/Okay, I will do that if that’s what you want
네, 갔다 올게요 = Yes/Okay, I will go, and then come back
