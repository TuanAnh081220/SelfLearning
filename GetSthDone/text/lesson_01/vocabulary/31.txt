This is the first time you are being introduced to a word that must be conjugated in order to be used. Visit Lesson 5 for more information. Any word that ends in “다” must be conjugated to be used. The conjugation of 이다 is different than other words. I introduce all of these conjugations in Lesson 9.
Common usages
제 이름은 __이에요 (My name is __)
이름이 뭐예요? (What is your name?)
저는 ____이에요 = I am a ______
Notes
“to be” can be many words in English. For example, I am, he is, they are, I was, they were. 이다 acts as all of these words.
Examples:
저는 예쁜 여자예요 = I am a beautiful girl
저 건물은 학교입니다 = That building is a school
그것은 사진이에요 = That thing is a picture
이 사람은 저의 누나예요 = This (person) is my sister
그것은 큰 비밀이었어요 = That was a big secret
저는 의사였어요 = I was a doctor
