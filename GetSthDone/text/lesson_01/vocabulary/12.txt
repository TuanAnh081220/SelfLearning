The pronunciation of this word is closer to “이걷”
이것 is often shortened to 이거 in speech.
Notes: When 이, 그 or 저 are placed before “것,” the result is a compound word. Therefore, when placing “것” after 이, 그 or 저, there should not be a space between the two.
Although it can be translated as “this thing,” 이것 itself is a pronoun and can be simplified to translate to “this.” For more information, see the explanation in Lesson 1.
