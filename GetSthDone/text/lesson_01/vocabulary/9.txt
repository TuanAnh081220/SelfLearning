Notes: 그 is another example of a “관형사” in Korean. 그 is placed before nouns that are being referred to from context or a previous sentence. For example, if your father is talking about a specific person, you can refer to “that person” by saying “그 사람.”
Common Usages:
그것 = that thing
그 사람 = that person
See more information about 관형사 in my description of “이” above.
Examples:
그 남자는 저의 아버지예요 = That man is my father
그 여자는 나랑 결혼하고 싶었어요 = That girl wanted to marry me
저는 그 책을 원해요 = I want that book
그 병원은 멉니다 = That hospital is far
그 여자의 머리카락은 깁니다 = That girls hair is long
