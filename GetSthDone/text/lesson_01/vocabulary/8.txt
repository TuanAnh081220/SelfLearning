Notes: Certain types of words can be placed before nouns to describe them. For example, adjectives can be placed before nouns to describe them (for example: a pretty girl). 이 is a type of word called a “관형사,” which isn’t an adjective, but is another type of word that can be placed before nouns to describe them. In English, “관형사” translates to a “modifier” or “a determiner.” 이 is placed before nouns within reaching distance to indicate that one is talking about “this” specific thing. For example:
이 사람 = this person
Other examples of determiners in Korean (and English) are:
그 사람 = that person
모든 사람 = all people
어떤 사람 = which person
It is easy to distinguish between a determiner and an adjective in Korean. Although both placed before nouns to “describe” them, the dictionary (ordinary) form of an adjective always ends in ~다 and must change in order to describe them. For example, 예쁘다 changes to 예쁜 when placed before a noun to describe it (See Lesson 3 for more information). Determiners keep their original form when placed before a noun. This might be too much grammar for you at this point, but make a note of it.
Example:
이 차는 너무 비싸요 = This car is too expensive
이 방은 넓습니다 = This room is big/wide
저는 이 영화를 더 이상 보고 싶지 않아요 = I don’t want to watch this movie anymore
이 고기는 돼지고기입니다 = This meat is pork
이 사람은 저의 누나예요 = This (person) is my sister
