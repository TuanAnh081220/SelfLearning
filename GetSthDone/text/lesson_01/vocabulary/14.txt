The pronunciation of this word is closer to “저걷”
저것 is often shortened to 저거 in speech.
Notes: When 이, 그 or 저 are placed before “것,” the result is a compound word. Therefore, when placing “것” after 이, 그 or 저, there should not be a space between the two.
Although it can be translated as “that thing,” 저것 itself is a pronoun and can be simplified to translate to “that.” For more information, see the explanation in Lesson 1.

우리 아빠는 저것을 싫어할 것 같아 = Dad will probably not like that (thing)
