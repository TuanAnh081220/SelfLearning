Notes: Many new Korean words are simply English words with a Korean pronunciation pronouncing “소파” in Korean will sound like “sofa.” Note that there is no way to pronounce the “F” sound in Korean. English words with an “F” that are borrowed to Korean usually use “ㅍ” to make the “F” sound.
Example
그는 소파에 앉아 있어요 = He is sitting on the couch
이 소파는 아주 편해요 = This sofa is very comfortable
애기는 높은 소파에서 떨어졌어요 = The baby fell from the high sofa
