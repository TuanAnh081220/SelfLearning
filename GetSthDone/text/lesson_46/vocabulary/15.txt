Notes: 워낙 has two meanings, and it is often hard to know which meaning is being used in a sentence. One meaning allows it to be used much like “아주” or “매우” to have the meaning of “very.” For example:
그 학생이 워낙 조용해요 = That student is very quiet
It can also be used to indicate that something has always been the case. This often translates to “originally” or “by nature,” and is similar to the meaning of “원래” in Korean. For example:
그 학생이 워낙 조용해요 = That student, by nature, is quiet
I talked about this with my wife. She said, even for her, it would be difficult to understand/decide which meaning is trying to be used by the speaker. As is typical in Korean, you would have to rely on the context of the conversation to help you decipher the meaning.
