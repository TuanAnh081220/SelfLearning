Notes: When children in Korea turn four years old, they usually attend an “어린이집” for one to three years. Sometime before they turn eight years old, they will start to attend a “유치원.” When they turn eight years old, they start attending elementary school. At an 어린이집, they will do some educational activities, but it is more of a care center. A 유치원 is more focused on education.
In Canada, kindergarten is usually connected with elementary schools. In Korea, kindergartens are usually businesses with no affiliation to an elementary school.
