Notes: The word “목소리” typically refers to one’s actual voice, as in the sound that comes out of one’s mouth. “음성” is typically placed before a noun to indicate that the noun is related to “voices.” For example, a voice recognition system in Korea would be called “음성인식시스템” but probably not a “목소리인식시스템”
