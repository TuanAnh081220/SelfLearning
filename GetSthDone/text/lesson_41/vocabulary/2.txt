Notes: When children in Korea turn four years old, they usually attend an “어린이집” for one to three years. Sometime before they turn eight years old, they will start to attend a “유치원.” When they turn eight years old, they start attending elementary school. At an 어린이집, they will do some educational activities, but it is more of a day care center. A 유치원 is more focused on education.
Common Usages:
어린이집을 다니다 = to attend a day care
어린이집에 보내다 = to send somebody to a day care
어린이집 선생님 = a person (or teacher) who works at a day care
Examples:
선생님은 밤에 우리를 위해 어린이집을 잠깐 열어 줬어요
= The teacher opened the daycare for us at night for a little bit (for us/me)
보통 유치원에 가기 전에 아이들은 어린이집에 가요
= Usually kids go to day care before they go to kindergarten
점점 더 일하는 여성들이 많아지면서 어린이집 수요는 늘고 있어요
= Gradually as there are more females who are working, the demand for day cares is increasing
