Notes: Using 잡수시다 shows a ridiculous amount of respect, and saying it to anybody other than people who deserve that amount of respect will most likely just make people laugh. When I first met my wife’s parents, I used ‘잡수시다’ and they both thought it was funny. I only reserve that word for the rare times that I have dinner with my wife’s grandparents – in which case, after the meal, I ask them: 잘 잡수셨어요? = Did you have a good meal?
