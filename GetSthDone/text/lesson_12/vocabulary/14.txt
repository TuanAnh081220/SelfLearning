Notes: 쪽 is a noun, but a special noun. I refer to these sometimes as “pseudo-nouns” in my lessons. Other nouns like this are 적 (Lesson 32) and 수 (Lesson 45). 쪽 can only ever be used when some sort of context is given to it.
You can see that if you describe it using the concepts in Lesson 26:
저는 다른 사람들이 가는 쪽으로 갈 거예요 = I will go in the direction that other people are going
Or, you can place a noun immediately before it:
저는 학교 쪽으로 갈 거예요 = I will go in the direction of school
Common things that 쪽 is placed after are words on their own. Similar how 이 것, 그 것 and 저 것 are actually words as 이것, 그것 and 저것. For example:
이쪽 = towards this direction
그쪽 = towards that direction
저쪽 = towards that direction
오른쪽 = to the right
왼쪽 = to the left
안쪽 = towards the inside
I talk about the use of 쪽 in a Korean sign in this Youtube Video.
Examples:
우리가 저쪽으로 가야 돼요 = We have to go that way (in that direction)
오른쪽으로 가세요 = Go right (in the direction of right)
왼쪽으로 가세요 = Go left (in the direction of left)
