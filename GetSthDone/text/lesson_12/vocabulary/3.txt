Common Usages:
목소리 = voice (literally, throat sound)
소리가 나다 = for a sound to be make
소리가 들리다 = for a sound to be heard
소리를 지르다 = to scream
무슨 소리야? = What is that sound?
This phrase literally means “what is that sound?” and it can be used to have that meaning.  However, it is commonly used to show disagreement to what somebody says. In English, this would be similar to saying “What are you talking about!?”
소리가 안 들려요 = I can’t hear the sound
The Korean sentence above is predicated by an intransitive verb (들리다), which means it cannot act on an object. The English translation is predicated by a transitive verb (to hear), which means it can act on an object. A more direct translation of the Korean sentence would be “the sound cannot be heard.” However, this phrase is often used to indicate that one cannot hear something.
Example:
무슨 소리예요? = What is that sound?
소리를 많이 질러도 그는 제 말을 듣지 못했어요 = Even though I screamed a lot, he didn’t hear my voice
This word appears in my Korean Sign Explanation Video #1.
