Notes: “one rooms” are a style of apartment in Korea that are very small and have everything (including kitchen, laundry area, living area and bedroom) put in one tiny space. It is also possible to say “투룸”(two room) or “쓰리룸” (three room). A “two room” apartment usually means “two bedrooms, plus a common area (kitchen, living area, etc),” and a “three room” apartment usually means “three bedrooms plus a common area.”
Examples:
보통 대학생들은 원룸에서 살아요 = Most university students live in one-rooms
이 방은 원룸이라서 너무 작아요 = This is a studio apartment, so it is too small
This word appears in my Korean Sign Explanation Video 4.
