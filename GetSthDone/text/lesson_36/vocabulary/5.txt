The pronunciation of this word is closer to “괄리비”
Notes: The most common way you will hear 관리비 used is to refer to the “management fees” of an apartment building that one lives in. In addition to the monthly rent, electricity, gas and water bills, tenants usually have to pay a fee to the management (or landlord) of their apartment. This usually covers expenses like garbage pickup, cleaning and maintenance.
Common Usages:
관리비를 내다 = to pay for the management fees
관리비가 오르다 = for management fees to raise
관리비가 내려가다  = for management fees to lower
Examples:
관리비는 매달 내야 하는 고정 비용이에요
= Management fees are a fixed expense that one has to pay every month
다음 달부터 우리 집주인이 관리비를 올릴 거예요
= The landlord will raise the management fee starting next month
