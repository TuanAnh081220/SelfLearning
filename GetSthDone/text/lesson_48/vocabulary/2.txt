Notes: When an animal has a baby, Korean people don’t call the mother “어머니.” Instead, they call them “어미.” For a Korean beginner, this word usually only comes up if you read children’s stories, where the characters are often animals.
Examples:
어미를 찾아도 이미 고양이 새끼가 다 죽었어요
= Regardless of if you find the mother, the baby cats (kittens) all died
어미는 새끼에게 먹이를 주기 위해 매일 아침마다 사냥을 해요
= The mother hunts every morning in order to feed her babies
