Notes: If you are the same age as somebody (especially in school), you can call them your “친구” (friend). You can refer to the people who are in grades below you as your “후배.” Even if they are your friends (of course, it is possible to have friends in a lower grade), you would generally not refer to them as your “friend.” Instead, you would call them your “후배.” This often creates an awkward translation for Korean people when they speak English. I have the following exchange with my students fairly regularly:
Me: Is that person your friend?
Student: No, he’s my junior
Me: So, you’re not friends with him?
Student: I am friends with him, but I can’t call him “my friend” because he is not my age.
Me: In English, you can be friends with anybody. It sounds unnatural to say “my junior.”
The opposite of “후배” is “선배” which typically translates to “one’s senior.”
Common Usages:
후배양성 = training your juniors
Examples:
저는 슬기의 고등학교 후배예요 = I’m Seulgi’s junior from high school
후배들이 봉사하는 것을 싫어하는 것 같아요 = It seems like our juniors don’t like volunteering
유명한 가수들은 후배양성을 위해 최선을 다해요 = Famous singers do their best to develop/train their juniors (singers younger than them)
