Notes: I would almost never say this word by itself. It is usually combined with some other words or syllables to mean “health preservation” (something).
Common Usages:
보건소 = health center
보건실 = “health room.” This is usually the “nurse’s office” in schools
세계보건기구 = the World Health Organization (WHO)
보건복지부 = Ministry of Health and Welfare
Examples:
보건소에서는 무료로 건강검진을 받을 수 있어요
= You can receive a free health checkup at the health center
이 문제는 시민보건에 아주 중요한 것 같아요
= It seems like this problem is very important to the health of the citizens
