선생님이 살이 찐 것 같아요 = It seems like the teacher gained weight
You would say this if you are looking at the teacher and noticed that (for example) his face looks a little bit fatter than usual. Of course, you can’t be sure if the teacher gained weight or not, but the evidence in-front of you leads you to believe that he/she did gain weight.
