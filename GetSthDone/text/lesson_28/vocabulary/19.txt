Notes: 자체 is a difficult word to describe, but usually fairly easy to grasp in one’s head. It reminds me of saying a phrase like “The car itself isn’t bad…” Here, what is the difference if I just say the phrase “The car isn’t bad…”?  Presented on their own, those two sentences have essentially the same meaning. However, when using the word “itself/himself/herself/etc” the speaker is stressing that the car is fine, but there is some other problem with the situation.
It is usually placed after a noun (for example, “차 자체”) or “그”
Examples: 차 자체가 괜찮지만 제가 그냥 팔고 싶어요 = The car itself is fine, I just want to sell it
그 생각 자체가 무서워요 = That thought itself is scary (just the thought of that is scary)
우리가 유일하게 무서워해야 하는 것은 무서움 자체 뿐이다 = The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
Person 1: 삶에 대해 무엇을 좋아합니까? = What do you like about life?
Person 2: 저는 삶 자체를 좋아합니다 = I like life itself
