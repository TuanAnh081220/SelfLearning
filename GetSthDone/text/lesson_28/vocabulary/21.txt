Notes: You will most commonly see this word on signs. Must like how in English, we don’t say the word “Caution” often, but you will see it printed on signs. When telling somebody to be cautious or “use caution” in speech, it is common to say “be careful.” The word “조심하다” translates to “to be careful,” but when used as a command, it is often used with the imperative ~(으)세요: 조심하세요!
Common Usages:
추락주의 = beware of falling down (watch your step)
전기주의 = be cautious of electricity (electrical hazard)
보행자주의 = be cautious of pedestrians
