Notes:
The word “점심” can refer to the time around noon, or the meal that is eaten at that time (lunch). To distinguish between them, 점심식사 (lunch) and 점심시간 (noonish) can also be used.
Examples:
점심으로 뭐 먹고 싶어요? = What do you want to eat for lunch?
저는 보통 점심식사로 과일만 먹어요 = I usually only eat fruit for lunch
점심은 어땠어요? = How was lunch?
점심을 먹었어? = Did you eat lunch?
오빠는 바닥에 앉아서 점심을 먹었어요 = My brother ate lunch sitting on the floor
