저는 과일도 좋아하고 야채도 좋아해요 = I like fruit, and I like vegetables too
*Notice that 도 can be added to both 과일 and 야채 in this example. In English, we would just say “I like apples and vegetables too.” That sentence only has one “too,” but in Korean, 도 can be used twice. That sentence before could also be said like this:
저는 과일과 야채도 좋아해요 = I like fruit and vegetables too
