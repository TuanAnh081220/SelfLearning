Common Usages:
당근을 자르다/썰다 = to cut/chop carrots
Notes: Young people often say “당근당근” to mean “obviously.” The actual word for obviously is “당연하다,” but because of the similar pronunciation, “당근” is often used as a joke.
Examples:
당근을 작은 조각으로 자르세요 = Cut the carrots into small pieces, please
저는 당근을 칼로 잘라서 냉장고에 넣었어요 = I cut carrots with a knife and then put them into the fridge
