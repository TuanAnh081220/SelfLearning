Common Usages:
무김치 = radish kimchi
Notes: A Korean radish is different from a western radish. In Canada, I am used to radishes that are red on the outside and about the size of a golf-ball. Korean radishes are about the size of an American football and green and white in color.
Example: 한국 사람들은 무김치를 많이 먹어요 = Korean people eat a lot of radish kimchi
