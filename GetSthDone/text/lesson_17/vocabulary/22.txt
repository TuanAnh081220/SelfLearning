Notes: In English “rich” is an adjective. Though there is an adjective in Korean that means “rich,” the noun “부자” is more commonly used. Note that this is not an adjective, but a noun that means a “rich person.” Therefore, when indicating that somebody is rich, Korean people usually attach 이다 to 부다. For example:
저의 친구는 부자야 = My friend is (a) rich (person)
More examples:
제 친구는 부자인 아버지를 자랑했어요 = My friend boasted about his rich father
그 사람은 10년 동안 열심히 일하고 부자가 되었어요 = That person worked hard for 10 years and then became a rich person
