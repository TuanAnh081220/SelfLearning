Common Usages:
마지막 날 = the last day
마지막 게임 = the last game

Notes: There are two similar but different meanings for the word “last” in English. 마지막 is used for only ONE of those meanings. 마지막 is used to talk about something that is the last thing in the end of sequence – as in “first meal… second meal… third meal… fourth meal… last meal.” It is NOT used to talk about something in the past, as in “last night I went to bed late.” See bellow in this lesson for more information.
