Notes: Counters are used in Korean to count various things. Different counters are used for things like people, books, animals, etc. “개” is the general counter that can be used to count most things that don’t have a specific counter (or if you don’t know the specific counter-word for something). See below in this lesson for more information.
Example:
펜 두 개를 주세요 = Give me two pens, please
저는 사과 한 개를 샀어요 = I bought one apple
저는 펜 두 개가 더 있어요 = I have two more pens
