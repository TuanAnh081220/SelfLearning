Notes: This can be added as a counter after a number to mean 1st/2nd/3rd/etc.
When saying “first”, “첫” replaces “한”.
저는 첫 번째 차를 싫어했어요 = I didn’t like that first car
After “first,” you can use the regular Korean numbers. Just like with counters, the numbers 2 – 4 change when 번째 follows. For example:
저는 두 번째 남자를 골랐어요 = I chose the second man
After the number four, the words don’t change when adding 번째. For example:
이 수업은 오늘 저의 열 번째 수업입니다 = This is my tenth class today
Examples:
저는 열 번째로 도착한 사람이었어요 = I was the 10th person to arrive
