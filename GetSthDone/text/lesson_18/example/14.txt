나는 여자 친구가 있어 = I have a girlfriend
나는 여자 친구를 가지고 있어 – this technically means “I have a girlfriend,” but it’s meaning is more similar to “I possess a girlfriend.” If you say something like this in Korean, Korean people will probably understand you, but laugh at your mistake (similar to if somebody told me that they possess a girlfriend in English).
