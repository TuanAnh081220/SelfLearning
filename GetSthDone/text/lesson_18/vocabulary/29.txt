It is easy to understand the meaning of 내부 and 외부 if you understand their simple Hanja origins. 내(內) means “inside” and 외(外) means “outside.” You don’t need to worry about the Chinese characters just yet, but knowing that 외 and 내 usually have these meanings can help you tremendously when learning new words. If you want to go further, 부(部) (as in, 내부 and 외부) means “part.” 내부 then means “the inside part/the inside”, and 외부 means “the outside part/the outside.”
Example:
백화점에는 외부 주차장도 있어요 = There is a parking lot outside the department store as well
이 쪽은 건물 외부로 나갈 수 있는 길이다 = This way/direction will take you outside (to the outer part of the) the building
