It is easy to understand the meaning of 내부 and 외부 if you understand their simple Hanja origins. 내(內) means “inside” and 외(外) means “outside.” You don’t need to worry about the Chinese characters just yet, but knowing that 외 and 내 usually have these meanings can help you tremendously when learning new words. If you want to go further, 부(部) (as in, 내부 and 외부) means “part.” 내부 then means “the inside part/the inside”, and 외부 means “the outside part/the outside.”
Example:
스타벅스의 내부 분위기는 매우 안락해요 = The atmosphere inside Starbucks is very comfortable
