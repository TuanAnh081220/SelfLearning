Common Usages:
새벽에 일어나다 = to wake up early
새벽 2 시에 = at 2:00 in the morning
Notes: The word 오전 generally refers to anything before noon, but 새벽 is used to refer to something that is really early in the morning. Typically, 새벽 refers to the time before the sun rises.
Example:
저는 매일 새벽 5시에 일어나요 = I wake up every day at 5 a.m.
This word appears in my Korean Sign Explanation Video #1.
