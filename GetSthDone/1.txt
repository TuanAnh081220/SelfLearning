Notes: Certain types of words can be placed before nouns to describe them. For example, adjectives can be placed before nouns to describe them (for example: a pretty girl). 이 is a type of word called a “관형사,” which isn’t an adjective, but is another type of word that can be placed before nouns to describe them. In English, “관형사” translates to a “modifier” or “a determiner.” 이 is placed before nouns within reaching distance to indicate that one is talking about “this” specific thing. For example:
이 사람 = this person
Other examples of determiners in Korean (and English) are:
그 사람 = that person
모든 사람 = all people
어떤 사람 = which person
It is easy to distinguish between a determiner and an adjective in Korean. Although both placed before nouns to “describe” them, the dictionary (ordinary) form of an adjective always ends in ~다 and must change in order to describe them. For example, 예쁘다 changes to 예쁜 when placed before a noun to describe it (See Lesson 3 for more information). Determiners keep their original form when placed before a noun. This might be too much grammar for you at this point, but make a note of it.
Example:
이 차는 너무 비싸요 = This car is too expensive
이 방은 넓습니다 = This room is big/wide
저는 이 영화를 더 이상 보고 싶지 않아요 = I don’t want to watch this movie anymore
이 고기는 돼지고기입니다 = This meat is pork
이 사람은 저의 누나예요 = This (person) is my sister
그 = that
Notes: 그 is another example of a “관형사” in Korean. 그 is placed before nouns that are being referred to from context or a previous sentence. For example, if your father is talking about a specific person, you can refer to “that person” by saying “그 사람.”
Common Usages:
그것 = that thing
그 사람 = that person
See more information about 관형사 in my description of “이” above.
Examples:
그 남자는 저의 아버지예요 = That man is my father
그 여자는 나랑 결혼하고 싶었어요 = That girl wanted to marry me
저는 그 책을 원해요 = I want that book
그 병원은 멉니다 = That hospital is far
그 여자의 머리카락은 깁니다 = That girls hair is long
저 = that (when something is far away)
Notes: 저 is another example of a “관형사” in Korean. 저 is placed before nouns that are far away (not within reach). For example, if you want to refer to the person across the street, you can refer to “that person” by saying “저 사람.”
그 and 저 both translate to “that.” This often causes confusion for English speakers.
Also notice that “저” has more than one meaning. Earlier, you saw that “저” means “I/me.” Welcome to the world of Korean! Where often times one word has more than one meaning.
Common Usages:
저것 = that thing
저 사람 = that person
See more information about 관형사 in my description of “이” above.

저 사람은 누구예요? = Who is that person?

이것 = this (thing)
The pronunciation of this word is closer to “이걷”
이것 is often shortened to 이거 in speech.
Notes: When 이, 그 or 저 are placed before “것,” the result is a compound word. Therefore, when placing “것” after 이, 그 or 저, there should not be a space between the two.

Notes
“to be” can be many words in English. For example, I am, he is, they are, I was, they were. 이다 acts as all of these words.
Examples:
저는 예쁜 여자예요 = I am a beautiful girl
저 건물은 학교입니다 = That building is a school
그것은 사진이에요 = That thing is a picture
이 사람은 저의 누나예요 = This (person) is my sister
그것은 큰 비밀이었어요 = That was a big secret
저는 의사였어요 = I was a doctor
네 = yes
Notes: Informally, you can say “응” to mean “yes”
When speaking on the phone, Korean people often say this many times and pronounce it as “데”
Example
네, 저는 가고 싶어요 = Yes, I want to go
네, 알겠습니다 = Yes, okay. (I got it)
네, 그렇습니다 = Yes, that is correct (that is the way it is)
네, 그럴게요 = Yes/Okay, I will do that if that’s what you want
네, 갔다 올게요 = Yes/Okay, I will go, and then come back
아니 = no
Notes
In formal situations, “아니요” is more respectful
Example
아니요, 안 했어요 = No, I didn’t do it
Person 1: 숙소비가 얼마예요? 10만원? = How much is the lodging fee? 100,000 won?
Person 2: 아니요. 10만원 조금 넘어요 = No. A little more than 100,000 won

Greeting Words
Throughout my lessons, I will only use grammar and vocabulary that you have learned from a previous lesson. In Unit 0, I taught you how to write words in Korean. Above, you can see the first set of words you should study to get you started. I have not yet taught you how to use those words or how conjugate them.
The words for “hello,” “thank you,” “how are you,” and “please” are actually quite difficult in Korean. There is actually grammar within the words themselves. At this stage, I would simply memorize these “greeting words” as one unit, and you can worry about the grammar within them later when it becomes relevant. The words are:
안녕하세요 = hello
감사하다 and 고맙다 are the two words that are commonly used to say “thank you.” However, they are rarely used in those forms and are almost always conjugated. They can be conjugated in a variety of ways, which will be introduced in Lesson 5 and Lesson 6. The most common ways to conjugate these words are:
감사합니다
감사해요
고마워
고맙습니다
고마워요
The way to say “how are you?” in Korean is:
잘 지내세요?  = How are you?
Although this is the most literal way to ask “how are you?” in Korean, it is not as common as the English expression. Korean people love food, and common way to greet somebody is to ask them if they have eaten. The idea of asking questions in Korean is taught in Lesson 21.
The way to say “please” in Korean is:
제발 = Please
It is, of course, important for you to memorize these expressions in Korean, but you need to know that there is a reason why they are said that way. For now, don’t worry about why they are said that way, and simply memorize them. We will get back to them in later lessons when they become important.

 
 
Sentence Word Order

One of the hardest things to wrap your head around in Korean is the alien-like sentence structure. For our purposes in Lesson 1, Korean sentences are written in the following order:
Subject – Object – Verb (for example: I hamburger eat)
Or
Subject – Adjective (for example: I beautiful)
I am going to quickly explain what a “subject” and “object” mean, as your ability to understand later concepts depends on your understanding of this.
The subject refers to person/thing/noun/whatever that is acting. The subject does the action of the verb. For example, the subject in each sentence below is underlined:
I went to the park
I will go to the park
My mom loves me
He loves me
The dog ran fast
The clouds cleared up
In English, the subject always comes before the verb.
The object refers to whatever the verb is acting on. For example, the object in each sentence below is underlined
My mom loves me
The dog bit the mailman
He ate rice
Students studied Korean
In English, the object always comes after the verb. However, a sentence with a verb does not require an object. For example:
I slept
I ate
He died
Sometimes there is no object because it has simply been omitted from the sentence. For example, “I ate” or “I ate rice” are both correct sentences. Other verbs, by their nature, cannot act on an object. For example, you cannot place an object after the verbs “to sleep” or “to go:”
I sleep you
I go you
Subjects are also present in sentences with adjectives. However, there is no object in a sentence with an adjective. The subjects are underlined in the following adjective-sentences below:
School is boring
I am boring
The movie was funny
The building is big
My girlfriend is pretty
The food is delicious
Verbs and adjectives are placed at the end of a sentence. Actually, every Korean sentence and clause must end in one of the following:
– A verb
– An adjective, or
– 이다
I talk about the meaning of 이다 later in this lesson. It is neither a verb nor an adjective, but it behaves like them. Every verb, every adjective and 이다 end in “다,” and these are the only words in Korean that can be conjugated.
Korean also has a formality system built into the language. That is, the way one speaks to an older person who deserves high respect would be different than the way one speaks to a friend. There are many ways words in a sentence can change depending on the formality of the situation, but the two most common, basic and important things to be aware of are:
1) There are two ways to say “I” or “me” in Korean:
나, used in informal situations, and
저, used in formal situations.
2) There are many ways to conjugate a word. As we saw above, the word 고맙다 can be conjugated many different ways. It is important to know which conjugation to use in which situation. This is taught in Lesson 6. Until Lesson 6, I make no distinction of formality and the focus is more on sentence structure than conjugations. Until then, you will see both 나 and 저 arbitrarily used. Don’t worry about why one is used over the other until Lesson 6, when formalities will be explained.
Okay, now that you know all of that, we can talk about making Korean sentences.

Korean Particles (~는/은 and ~를/을)

Most words in a Korean sentence have a particle (a fancy word to say ‘something’) attached to them. These particles indicate the role of each word in a sentence – that is, specifically which word is the subject or object. Note that there is absolutely no way of translating these particles to English, as we do not use anything like them.
The following are the particles you should know for this lesson:
는 or 은 (Subject)
This is placed after a word to indicate that it is the subject of a sentence.
Use 는 when the last letter of the last syllable of the subject is a vowel. For example:
나 = 나는
저 = 저는
Use 은 when the last letter of the last syllable of the subject is a consonant. For example:
집 = 집은
책 = 책은
를 or 을 (Object)
This is placed after a word to indicate that is the object of a sentence.
Use 를 when the last letter of the last syllable is a vowel. For example:
나 = 나를
저 = 저를
Use을 when the last letter of the last syllable is a consonant. For example:
집 = 집을
책 = 책을
We can now make sentences using the Korean sentence structure and the Korean particles.
1) I speak Korean = I는 Korean을 speak
는 is attached to “I” (the subject)
을 is attached to “Korean” (the object)
2) I like you = I는 you를 like
는 is attached to “I” (the subject)
를 is attached to “you” (the object)
3) I wrote a letter = I는 letter을 wrote
는 is attached to “I” (the subject)
을 is attached to “letter” (the object)
4) I opened the door = I는 door을 opened
는 is attached to “I” (the subject)
을 is attached to “the door” (the object)
5) My mom will make pasta = My mom은 pasta를 will make
은 is attached to “my mom” (the subject)
를 is attached to “pasta” (the object)
The same could be done for sentences with adjectives. However, remember that sentences with adjectives will not have an object:
1) My girlfriend is pretty: My girlfriend은 is pretty
“은” is attached to “my girlfriend” (the subject)
2) The movie was scary = The movie는 was scary
“는” is attached to “the movie” (the subject)
We will now switch our focus to using actual Korean words to create sentences ending in 이다.

 
 
To be: 이다
Let’s start building sentences in Korean. In this lesson, we will start by making simple sentences using the word 이다. The translation for “이다” is “to be.”  English speakers often don’t realize how difficult the word “to be” is. Depending on who is being referred to, the word “to be” could be any of the underlined words below:
I am a man
He is a man
They are men
I was a man
They were men
In each of those sentences, a different word (is, am, are, was, were) is used depending on the subject and tense of the sentence. I can’t imagine how difficult this would be for an English learner. In Korean, the 이다 is used to represent all of those “to be” words.
As mentioned earlier, 이다 can be conjugated. In that way, 이다 is similar to verbs and adjectives, but the rules for 이다 are often (but not always) different. I will teach you how 이다 differs from verbs and adjectives as it becomes important in later lessons. For example, in Lesson 52 you will learn that the process for quoting a sentence with 이다 is different than with verbs and adjectives.
Like adjectives, 이다 can not act on an object. Only verbs can act on objects. For example:
I eat hamburgers (eat is a verb, the object is a hamburger)
She meets my friend (meet is a verb, the object is my friend)
They study Korean (study is a verb, the object is Korean)
We listen to music (listen is a verb, the object is music)
All of those sentences (can) have objects because the verb is the predicate of the sentence. However, in sentences that are predicated by adjectives, there will not be an object
I am pretty
She is beautiful
They are hungry
We are smart
Look at those four sentences. When we use adjectives in English, we must also use “to be” words like am, is and are. In other words, we cannot make sentences like this:
I pretty
She beautiful
They hungry
We smart
Unlike in English, 이다 is not used in these types of sentences. That is, we do not use 이다 to indicate that something “is” an adjective. The structure of sentences predicated by adjectives is discussed in Lesson 3.
So, 이다 is not used in these types of sentences:
I am pretty
She is beautiful
They are hungry
We are smart
However, 이다 is used in these types of sentences:
I am a man
He is a man
They are men
I was a man
They were men
이다 is used to indicate that a noun is a noun. The basic structure for a sentence predicated by “이다” is:
[noun은/는] [another noun][이다]
For example:
I는 man이다 = I am a man
Now substitute the words for “man” and “I,” which are:
나 = I
남자 = man
The Korean sentence would look like this:
나는 남자이다 = I am a man
Notice that 이다 is attached directly to the second noun. Verbs and adjectives are not attached to nouns like this, but 이다 is. It would be incorrect to include a space between the second noun and 이다. For example, this would be incorrect:
나는 남자 이다
Although it might look and feel like “남자” is an object in that sentence, it is not. 이다, like adjectives and unlike verbs cannot act on an object. It would be incorrect to include the object particle on the second noun. For example, this would be incorrect:
나는 남자를 이다

The focus of this lesson (and Lessons 2, 3 and 4) is to introduce you to simple Korean sentence structure. Until you reach Lessons 5 and Lesson 6 you will not be exposed to the conjugations and honorifics of Korean verbs, adjectives and 이다. These words are very rarely used without conjugations and honorifics.
The conjugation of sentences is very important, but so is the structure of sentences. When creating these lessons, I went back in forth many times thinking about which one I should present first. You can’t conjugate sentences if you don’t have a logical sentence to conjugate; and you can’t create a logical sentence if you don’t know how to conjugate it. In the end, I figured it would make more sense to present the information this way – where learners are introduced to sentence structure and then learn how to conjugate the words within the sentence.
Throughout all of my lessons, I use example sentences to show how grammar can be used. The example sentences in Lessons 1 – 4 are not conjugated. However, directly beneath each non-conjugated sentence is a conjugated version of the same sentence in parenthesis (one formal and one informal conjugation). You might want to glimpse at how the words are conjugated, but remember that this will be taught in Lessons 5 and 6 (for verbs and adjectives) and Lesson 9 (for 이다).

Other examples of 이다 in use:
나는 여자이다 = I am a woman
(나는 여자야 / 저는 여자예요)
나는 선생님이다 = I am a teacher
(나는 선생님이야 / 저는 선생님이에요)
나는 사람이다 = I am a person
(나는 사람이야 / 저는 사람이에요)
나는 ______이다 = I am a _______
(나는 _______ 이야 / 저는 _____이에요)
You can substitute any noun into the blank space to make these sentences.
The words “this” and “that” are often used as the subject of these types of sentences. Let’s now look at how we can apply 이것, 그것 and 저것 to sentences with 이다.
 
 

 
 
This and That (이/그/저)
You can see in the vocabulary above that the word for “this” is 이 in Korean.
We use 이 in Korean when we are talking about something that is within touching distance (For example: this pen – i.e. the one I am holding). Just like in English “이” (this) is placed before the noun it is describing. For example:
이 사람 = This person
이 남자 = This man
이 여자 = This woman
이 차 = This car
이 탁자 = This table
이 의자 = This chair
Unfortunately, there are two words for “that”: 그 and 저. Early learners of Korean are always confused with the difference between “그” and “저.”
We use 그 when we are talking about something from a previous sentence or from previous context, regardless of if you could see it or not. Providing examples would be too difficult right now because you do not know any Korean sentences. However, if I were to say: “I don’t like that man [when your friend mentioned him in a previous sentence].” The word “that” in that sentence would be how “그” is used.
We use 저 when we are talking about something that we can see, but cannot touch because it is too far away.
We can place “그” or “저” before a noun to describe “this” or “that” thing just like we did with “이.”
이 사람 = This person
그 사람 = That person
저 사람 = That person
이 남자 = This man
그 남자 = That man
저 남자 = That man
이 여자 = This woman
그 여자 = That woman
저 여자 = That woman
이 의자 = This chair
그 의자 = That chair
저 의자 = That chair
이 탁자 = This table
그 탁자 = That table
저 탁자 = That table
Again, although the English translations of “그” and “저” are the same, it is important to remember that they are not the same word in Korean.
One of the most common words in Korean is “것” meaning “thing.” When 이, 그 or 저 are placed before “것,” the result is a compound word. Therefore, when placing “것” after 이, 그 or 저, there should not be a space between the two. In other words, the following are words in and within themselves, and not two separate words:
이것 = this thing
그것 = that thing
저것 = that thing
We see this same phenomenon happen with other common words that you learn in future lessons. You don’t need to worry about this now, but we see this same thing happen with the word 곳 (meaning “place”) and 때 (meaning “time”).
With these words, the word “thing” isn’t necessary in the English translation. Let me explain.
I’ll use “that” as an example, but the same idea can be applied to the word “this.”
“That” can be placed before a noun to describe it. As we saw earlier:
That person
That man
That woman
However, it can also be a noun itself. For example:
I like that
In this type of English sentence, “that” is referring to some thing that you like. It is a noun. It is a thing.
Therefore, the sentence could just as easily be said as:
I like that thing
I don’t like to use grammatical jargon in my lessons, but if you know what these words mean, it could be helpful. In both English and Korean, “that” can be a determiner (as in, “I like that man”), and it can also be a pronoun (as in “I like that”). When used as a determiner in Korean, you should place 그 before a noun. When used as a pronoun in Korean, the word 그것 is used.
In this same respect, while “이, 그 and 저” translate to “this, that and that” respectively, and are placed before nouns to indicate “this noun, that noun and that noun,” “이것, 그것 and 저것” are nouns (they are pronouns). Therefore, they do not need to be followed by the redundant word “thing,” although their meanings would be exactly the same:
I like this
I like this thing
I like that
I like that thing
We can now use these nouns as subjects or objects in a sentence. We will look at how they can be used with “이다” next.

Using This/That with 이다
Remember, 이다 translates to “to be” and is conjugated as “am/is/are” in English. Now that we know how to use 이, 그 and 저 (and 이것, 그것 and 저것), we can now make sentences like this:
That person is a doctor
We can start by putting those words into the Korean structure:
That person는 doctor is
And then changing the English words to the appropriate Korean words:
그 사람은 +  의사 + 이다
그 사람은 의사이다
(그 사람은 의사야 / 그 사람은 의사예요)
More examples:
그 사람은 선생님이다 = That person is a teacher
(그 사람은 선생님이야 / 그 사람은 선생님이에요)
이것은 탁자이다 = This (thing) is a table
(이것은 탁자야 / 이것은 탁자예요)
저것은 침대이다 = That (thing) is a bed
(저것은 침대야 / 저것은 침대예요)
그 사람은 남자이다 = That person is a man
(그 사람은 남자야 / 그 사람은 남자예요)
그 사람은 여자이다 = That person is a woman
(그 사람은 여자야 / 그 사람은 여자예요)
그것은 차이다 = That (thing) is a car
(그것은 차야 / 그것은 차예요)
이것은 나무이다 = This (thing) is a tree
(이것은 나무야 / 이것은 나무예요)

Wow! That was an extremely difficult lesson. If you were to pick up another Korean text book, I am sure the first chapter would be much easier than this. Trust me though; learning this at the start will be very useful to you later on. When I was learning how to speak Korean, it took me months to realize some of these things (not because they were hard, but because I was using a text book that never taught me the reason why things are the way they are in Korean).
Before you move on, make sure you understand the simple Korean sentence structure presented in this first lesson. Also, remember that the sentences not in parentheses are technically incorrect (or very very uncommon) because they have not been conjugated.
